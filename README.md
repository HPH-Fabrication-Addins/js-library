Keeping fixtures and factories in parity with your APIs can be a time consuming process.
Polly alleviates this by recording and maintaining actual server responses without foregoing flexibility.

- Record your test suite's HTTP interactions and replay them during future test runs for fast, deterministic, accurate tests.
- Use Polly's client-side server to modify or intercept requests and responses to simulate different application states (e.g. loading, error, etc.).

```js

import XHRAdapter from '@pollyjs/adapter-xhr';
import FetchAdapter from '@pollyjs/adapter-fetch';
import RESTPersister from '@pollyjs/persister-rest';

/*
  Register the adapters and persisters we want to use. This way all future
  polly instances can access them by name.
*/
Polly.register(XHRAdapter);
Polly.register(FetchAdapter);
Polly.register(RESTPersister);

describe('Netflix Homepage', function() {
  it('should be able to sign in', async function() {
    /*
      Create a new polly instance.

      Connect Polly to both fetch and XHR browser APIs. By default, it will
      record any requests that it hasn't yet seen while replaying ones it
      has already recorded.
    */
    const polly = new Polly('Sign In', {
      adapters: ['xhr', 'fetch'],
      persister: 'rest'
    });
    const { server } = polly;

    /* Intercept all Google Analytic requests and respond with a 200 */
    server
      .get('/google-analytics/*path')
      .intercept((req, res) => res.sendStatus(200));

    /* Pass-through all GET requests to /coverage */
    server.get('/coverage').passthrough();

    /* start: pseudo test code */
    await visit('/login');
    await fillIn('email', 'polly@netflix.com');
    await fillIn('password', '@pollyjs');
    await submit();
    /* end: pseudo test code */

    expect(location.pathname).to.equal('/browse');

    /*
      Calling `stop` will persist requests as well as disconnect from any
      connected browser APIs (e.g. fetch or XHR).
    */
    await polly.stop();
  });
});
```

The above test case would generate the following [HAR](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/)
file which Polly will use to replay the sign-in response when the test is rerun:
